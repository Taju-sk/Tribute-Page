                Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda Eiichirō, born
                January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the
                series One Piece.The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named
                one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.

                Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan. At the
                age of four he resolved to become a manga artist in order to avoid
                having to get a "real job".His biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and
                his series Dragon Ball.He recalls that his interest in pirates was
                probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky the
                Viking.He submitted a character named Pandaman for Yudetamago's
                classic wrestling manga Kinnikuman. Pandaman was not only used in a
                chapter of the manga but would later return as a recurring cameo
                character in Oda's own works.

                At the age of 17, Oda submitted his work Wanted! and won several
                awards, including second place in the coveted Tezuka Award. That got
                him into a job at the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine, where he originally
                worked as assistant manga artist/assistant to Shinobu Kaitani's series
                Suizan Police Gang before moving to Masaya Tokuhiro on Jungle King
                Tar-chan and Mizu no Tomodachi Kappaman, which gave him an unexpected
                influence on his artistic style. At the age of 19, he began working as
                an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki on Rurouni Kenshin, before winning
                the Hop Step Award for new manga artists. Watsuki credits Oda for
                helping create the character Honjō Kamatari who appears in Rurouni
                Kenshin.
            </p>

            <p class="para-content">
                During this time, Oda drew two pirate-themed one-shot stories called
                "Romance Dawn", which were published in Akamaru Jump and Weekly Shōnen
                Jump respectively in late 1996."Romance Dawn" featured Monkey D. Luffy
                as the protagonist, who then became the protagonist of One Piece.

            <p class="para-content">
                In 1997, One Piece began serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump and has
                become not only one of the most popular manga in Japan, but the
                best-selling manga series of all time. It sold 100 million collected
                tankōbon volumes by February 2005, over 200 million by February 2011,
                had 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014, 430 million
                volumes in circulation worldwide as of October 2017, 440 million
                copies sold as of May 2018 and 450 million in print as of March 2019.
            </p>

            <p class="para-content">
                Additionally, individual volumes of One Piece have broken publishing
                records in Japan. Volume 56 received the highest initial print run of
                any manga, 2.85 million copies, in 2009. Volume 57's print of 3
                million in 2010 was the highest first print for any book in Japan, not
                just manga. A record that was broken several times by subsequent
                volumes and currently held by 67's 4.05 million initial printing in
                2012.[24] In 2013, the series won the 41st Japan Cartoonists
                Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama's Nekodarake
                Nice.

                Oda a father for the first time. Three years later, Oda and Inaba aged 34 and 31 respectively, welcomed
                a second daughter born sometime in 2009.</p>
            <p class="para-content">Due to his rigorous work schedule, Oda lives apart from his wife and daughters,
                receiving visits from them roughly once per week. He usually visits their home during holiday breaks; an
                opulent mansion located in Nerima (練馬区, Nerima-ku), a neighborhood in the metropolitan area of Tokyo
                where his wife and daughters reside. Oda bought this house in 2006, after the birth of his eldest
                daughter. Oda, Inaba and their daughters go on vacation abroad approximately once a year.</p>
